All this code is written in VEXcode and CAN'T be opened in Visual Studio Code. Download it [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5?srsltid=AfmBOooLqGvS6CJVXo5Hw9S5hdWSIjm8BiffgctBdFSB1OQrjkVQGCjg). <br>
By applying derivatives to calculate the correlation between the program's degree and the robot's actual rotation degree, we won the Innovative Award for optimizing pathfinding algorithms without using a Gyro Sensor so you might NOT need one. (Programmed in C++, but can be switched to VEXcode, a block-based language like Scratch)
